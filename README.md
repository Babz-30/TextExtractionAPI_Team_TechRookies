# Project Title: ML 24/25-10 Creating Text from Images with OCR API

## Abstract
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology used for text extraction from images, but low-quality images, noise, and distortion affect its performance. Our project discusses an efficient method of enhancing the OCR accuracy to extract printed text from images by applying combinations of preprocessing techniques. OpenAI is used to compute text embeddings of the extracted text, which is further used to calculate cosine similarity between preprocessing techniques. The study is performed on images of bills, car license plates, and passport documents etc. The text from each of the preprocessing techniques, like binarization, grayscale, rotation, invert, canny, mirror, and histogram, shall be assessed through cosine similarity, dictionary-based accuracy, and confidence score for mean page word count to determine the best preprocessing methodology. There is a ranking method that ranks procedures based on text similarity, dictionary accuracy, and confidence without allowing misleading similarities and low-accuracy results. The proposed method ensures that only the most accurate preprocessing technique is chosen, resulting in higher OCR accuracy.

## Introduction
We have developed an advanced text extraction application that leverages the Tesseract OCR SDK for extracting text from images. The process begins with a series of preprocessing techniques designed to enhance the quality of the image and improve OCR accuracy. These preprocessing steps include combination of:

- **Image rotation**: Adjusting image orientation to standardize text positioning.
- **HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) color space transformations**: Adjusting the image's color balance.
- **Inversion**: Swapping the text and background colors.
- **Resizing**: Adjusting the image based on DPI (dots per inch) resolution to ensure optimal scaling for text extraction.
- **Grayscale conversion**: Reducing image complexity.
- **Binarization**: Converting the image into black and white.

Once the image is processed, text is extracted using the Tesseract OCR engine, which is a robust open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool. After text extraction, we compute metrics such as:

- **Text embedding**: Converting the text into numerical representations for analysis.
- **Cosine similarity**: Comparing the extracted text between different preprocessing technique.
- **Dictionary accuracy**: Measuring the proportion of recognized words that exist in a predefined dictionary.
- **Mean word confidence**: The average confidence score of the words detected by the OCR system.

The calculated metrics are then saved in a [`ExtractedTextMeanConfidence.csv`](Source/OCRApplication/OCRApplication/Output/Tesseract_Output/ExtractedTextMeanConfidence.csv) and [`CosineSimilarityMatrix.csv`](Source/OCRApplication/OCRApplication/Output/Cosine_Similarity_Output/CosineSimilarityMatrix.csv) file for further analysis and reporting. Through data mining techniques, we handle and filter out false similarity results to improve accuracy. The best preprocessing technique is identified based on the above metrics, and the extracted text is displayed on the console for the user to review. This application provides an efficient and reliable solution for text extraction from images, offering a detailed analysis of OCR accuracy through computational metrics. The extracted text, preprocessed images, and computational metrics are stored in the `Output` folder.
